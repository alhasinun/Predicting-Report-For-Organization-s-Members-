# Predicting Report For Organization's Members

This is my second code in github. Github is my place to exercise my skills in coding, so i will keep posting in here to implement my knowledge in programming related to data analysis or data science.

In this repository, i still use Python just like before. But, unlike before, this time i am doing data science problem. I am implementing machine learning method to predict progress report of organization's members based on the parameters of the previous report. For this case, i am using classification of supervised learning, because i try to predict the report based on the previous report which included previous parameters and labels.

Here are the steps to do that.
